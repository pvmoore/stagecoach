# Stagecoach Lang Stage One

![Logo](/resources/logo-1024.png)

Stagecoach is a compiler project that aims to implement a custom programming language in stages of increasing
complexity. This is Stage One which implements basic functionality. 

It utilizes the D programming language for implementation and LLVM 20 for code generation. This project serves as a foundation for exploring compiler design and language features.
